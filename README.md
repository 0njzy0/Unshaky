# Unshaky

![Menubar](README/menubar.png)

**Unshaky** tries to address an issue on the butterfly keyboard (Macbook & MacBook Pro 2016 or later): Double Key Press (See "User complaints" below). 

Apple made it difficult to replace the keyboard only and it could cost hundreds of dollars. **Unshaky** might save your keyboard by dismissing such "second key hits" (any second key presses that occur no later than 40ms after the previous one). My "w" key becomes normal with **Unshaky**, if it does not work for you, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Aahung/Unshaky/issues).

Good news, Apple just launched a [Keyboard Service Program for MacBook and MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/), and go get your keyboard fixed.
