**Unshaky** tries to address an issue on the butterfly keyboard (Macbook & MacBook Pro 2016 or later): Double Key Press (See "User complaints" below). 

Apple made it difficult to replace the keyboard only and it could cost hundreds of dollars. **Unshaky** might save your keyboard by dismissing such "second key hits" (any second key presses that occur no later than 40ms after the previous one, the delay is configurable). My "w" key becomes normal with **Unshaky**, if it does not work for you, open an issue [here](https://github.com/Aahung/Unshaky/issues).

Good news, Apple launched a [Keyboard Service Program for MacBook and MacBook Pro](https://www.apple.com/ca/support/keyboard-service-program-for-macbook-and-macbook-pro/), and go get your keyboard fixed, maybe temporarily.
